				<p>With a hectic city life, HK people always in a desire to enjoy private moments with family and friends. Dining out at restaurant can be an option but not 100% hassle-free. Sometimes, they just want to relax and enjoy a meal that custom made for them or they don’t want to stand in line at the supermarket and spend the evening washing dishes. Therefore, some individual private chefs start providing “cook-at-your-home” service.<BR>
The chef will take care everything from visiting the wet markets, preparing and cooking the dishes and meal serving, so that the host can enjoy meals, chit-chatting with your guests at home till late. <BR>
No. of service provider in the market keeps growing but they are all doing promotion as an individual basis, only limited scope of potential customer being reached. Vice versa, choices for customers also rare as everything just come from referral. <BR>
In addition, lots of personal chefs prefer to spend their effort and time on providing creative cuisine and servicing their customers instead of wasting their time on marketing promotion because they don’t view themselves as marketing experts. It’s very hard for them to attract enough clients and profit to sustain their personal chef business, if no one knows they exist in the market and provide such services. <BR>
Cook Easy website will function as a central web platform serving like an intermediary. Once the visitors have successfully signed up for a Cook Easy account, the personal chefs can post their service information or the foodie can send a home catering service request on our website. With our real-time and powerful online booking system, the foodie can send an enquiry and get a quote from the personal chefs or the chefs can manage their booking calendar, review their booking history anytime.
