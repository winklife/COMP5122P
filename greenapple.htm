<h5>Cooking Addict</h5>

<p>I'm new to your forum but not to cooking. I'm a cooking addict, as I'm sure many reading these pages are, and love all things related to cooking.<BR>
 
I started cooking when I was 4 years old including lighting the stove with a match. I would sneak into the kitchen during the night to cook.<BR>
 
Currently I help the Knights of Columbus run the Church kitchen here in Southern California.<BR>
 
I'm glad to be here.</p>
